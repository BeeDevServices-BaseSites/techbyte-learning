                What is Less?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Less is a dynamic stylesheet language that is used to make the process of styling websites more efficient and streamlined. It can be thought of as a more advanced version of CSS, the standard language used to design the layout and appearance of websites. Less allows developers to write code in a more intuitive and organized manner, making it easier to maintain and update styles across a website. By utilizing variables, mixins, and functions, Less enables users to create more complex and reusable styles, ultimately leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.            </p>

                For someone unfamiliar with Less, it may seem like a complex and unfamiliar concept. However, the benefits of using Less are significant in simplifying the process of styling websites. In essence, Less provides a way to write CSS in a more efficient and organized manner, making it easier to create and maintain styles across a website. By utilizing Less, even individuals with no coding experience can easily customize the appearance of a website without having to delve into the intricacies of CSS.

                Here is an example of Less used to style a button:
            </h5>
            <div className="code_box">
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        // Define a variable for a color<br/>
                        @primary-color: #3366cc;<br/>
                        <br/>
                        //Define a mixin for a box shadow<br/>
                        .box-shadow (@x, @y, @blur, @color: #000) &#123;<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;box-shadow: @x @y @blur @color;<br/>
                        &#125;<br/>
                        <br/>
                        // Define a style for a button using the variables and mixins<br/>
                        .button &#123;<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; background-color: @primary-color;<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; color: white;<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; padding: 10px 20px;<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; border-radius: 5px;<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; .box-shadow(2px, 2px, 5px);<br/>
                        &#125;<br/>
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            {/* END CODE EXAMPLE */}
            {/* EXAMPLE RESULT */}
            <h5 className="center_text">
                Here is our result:
            </h5>
            <div className="code_box_result css">
                <button id="example_button_sass"> Less Button </button>

            {/* END EXAMPLE RESULT */}
            <p>
                Similar to Sass, Less offers developers a more efficient and organized way to style websites, making it easier to create and maintain styles across a website. By harnessing the power of variables, mixins, and functions, Less allows for cleaner and more maintainable code, ultimately simplifying the process of web design.
