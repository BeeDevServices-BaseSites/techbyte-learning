                VS Code, short for Visual Studio Code, is a software application used by developers to write and edit code for various programming languages. It provides a user-friendly interface with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools to help programmers create and troubleshoot their code efficiently. VS Code is a popular choice among developers for its flexibility and customization options, allowing users to install extensions and customize settings to suit their individual workflow.

                Below is a simple example of code written in HTML, a common language used for creating web pages. This code snippet demonstrates how VS Code can help developers write and test code quickly and effectively in a visually appealing and organized manner.

                Sample Code:
            </h5>
            <div className="code_box">
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html/&gt; <br />
                        &lt;html&gt; <br />
                        &lt;head&gt; <br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;title/&gt; <br />
                        &lt;head/&gt; <br />
                        &lt;body&gt; <br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;h1/&gt;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;This is a simple web page&lt;p/&gt;<br />
                        &lt;body/&gt; <br />
                        &lt;html/&gt; <br />
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                This code creates a basic webpage with a heading that says "Hello, World!" and a paragraph of text. VS Code's syntax highlighting feature helps distinguish different elements of the code, making it easier for developers to identify errors and make changes as needed. It also allows for real-time previews of the web page to see how the code will look when rendered in a browser.
