                    <span>H</span>TML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized system used for creating and structuring web pages and web applications. It consists of a series of elements, or tags, that define the different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML is the foundation of all web development and is essential for creating a visually appealing and functional website. It works in conjunction with other web technologies, such as CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, to create dynamic and engaging web content.

                <p>
                In HTML, each tag is enclosed in angle brackets, with the opening tag defining the beginning of an element and the closing tag indicating the end. Attributes can also be added to tags to provide additional information or functionality to an element. By using a combination of HTML tags and attributes, web developers can create a structure and design for a webpage that is easily interpreted by web browsers. Ultimately, HTML is a crucial tool for anyone looking to build a website or web application, as it provides the framework for organizing and presenting content on the internet.
